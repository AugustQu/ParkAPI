## ParkAPI

ParkAPI is a small project trying to consolidate pages where cities publish the amount of empty spaces on their public parking lots (albeit as HTML) into a simple to use JSON API. It's trying to become the new backend for ParkenDD ([iOS](https://github.com/kiliankoe/ParkenDD) & [Android](https://github.com/jklmnn/ParkenDD)).

Currently it's just a tiny python flask powered server and definitely nowhere near ready for actual usage. 

The idea here is to also include some more fun features like automatic time-based scraping and caching those results for quicker responses and reduced load on the servers providing data or providing forecast data right alongside.

Let's see where this goes :)
